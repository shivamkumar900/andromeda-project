**Project Title**
BookBlock â€“ Get tokenized books and manuscripts

**Project Description**
BookBlock is a decentralized NFT marketplace where readers and collectors can purchase tokenized versions of real-world books and manuscripts.

**Key Features**

* Buy tokenized books and manuscripts as NFTs using UANDR
* Each book NFT represents verifiable digital ownership
* Simple interface for browsing and purchasing literary works
* Supports one-time limited sales with countdown timers
* Powered by AndromedaOS for secure and on-chain marketplace logic
